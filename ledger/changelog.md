# Model changelog

Every change to the live model's parameters, newest last. Written by the weekly improvement loop
(improve/improve.py) when a change passes the gate or is reverted after probation; structural changes
made by the improvement agent are logged here too. The full record of every experiment, including the
rejected ones, is ledger/experiments.jsonl.
